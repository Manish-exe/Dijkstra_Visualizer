# Shortest Path Finder

## Overview

The **Shortest Path Finder** is a web-based application that allows users to create their own custom graphs and visualize the shortest paths from a specified source node to all other nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The app highlights the shortest path on the graph, providing an intuitive understanding of how the algorithm works.

## Technologies Used
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beee07d2-8b3b-4a53-a43f-8f3483db285e)
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic of the graph creation, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and the dynamic interaction within the app.


## Features

- **Custom Graph Creation**: Users can create their own graph by adding nodes and edges as desired.
- **Edge Editing**: Users can edit the weights of the edges, allowing for dynamic changes to the graph.
- **Shortest Path Highlighting**: After running the algorithm, the shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes are calculated, and the shortest path is highlighted directly on the graph.
- **Interactive and User-Friendly Interface**: The application is entirely web-based, making it easy to use without any installation requirements.


## How to Use

1. **Create Your Graph**:
   - Click to add nodes to the canvas.
   - Select two nodes to create edges between those nodes. The default edge weight can be edited.
2. **Edit Edges**:
   - Click on an edge's weight to edit it directly on the graph.
3. **Find the Shortest Path**:
   - Enter the source node from which you want to calculate the shortest path.
   - Click the "Run" button to execute the algorithm.
   - The application will highlight the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes.

## Installation

This application is entirely web-based and does not require any installation. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the Shortest Path Finder.
